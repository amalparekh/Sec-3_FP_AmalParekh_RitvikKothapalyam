title: Stat 184 Final Project Guidelines
date: Fall 2025
---

This repo will serve as the template file for the course project, providing you with an initial README file, two CSL files (APA7 and MLA9) for reference citation styles, initial .gitignore and .lintr files, and the project guidelines (this file).

This Project Guidelines file contains all of the guidelines for the project, including key dates and a list of learning outcomes assessed. Further, we've attempted to provide you with some hints and suggestions. Be sure to read through all portions of the Project Guidelines carefully.

# Project Context and Purpose

The context for this project is that you've made it to the last round of a hiring process for the company Big Data, Inc.--one of the top data analysis firms in the world. They are looking for the best statisticians, data scientists, and data analysts to join the firm.

In the last stage of the hiring process, they want to see what you can do and how you work as part of a team. Thus, this project acts as your demonstration of your skills and knowledge.

The purpose of this project is to provide you with an opportunity to put into practice *everything* that you have learned over the course of the semester and to push yourselves. To this end, you'll work in teams to conduct your own Exploratory Data Analysis, posing and answering your own research question(s).

## Key Dates

There are multiple key dates that you and your project team are going need to be aware of as you complete this project.

- [ ] Locate appropriate data sources for your project. See the [Data Requirements](#data-requirements) section for important restrictions.
- [ ] Create a repo using the template repo. Name your repo `Sec#_FP_Name1_Name2_Name3` where `Sec#` is your section of Stat184 (i.e., `Sec1`, `Sec2`, `Sec3`, or `Sec5`) and `Name#` is replaced with the names of each team member.
  - [ ] The owner of the repo should be `Stat184-Fall2025`. 
  - [ ] Make sure that each team member has access to the repo.
- [ ] Use GitHub appropriately.
  - [ ] Have a proper README file for the repo.
  - [ ] Each member must have at least five (5) commits with appropriate subjects/messages.
  - [ ] The team should use the Issues feature regularly and appropriately.
  - [ ] The team should use branches; there should be at least a main branch and one "dev" branch for each team member.

  - [ ] Use a QMD file; the output type is PDF.
  - [ ] The report should be well organized with section headings.
  - [ ] Code should __only__ be found in a Code Appendix at the end for a PDF, not in the body of your report.
  - [ ] Data visualizations should be appropriately sized--not too small and not too big.
    - [ ] Figures and Tables should have appropriate captions and appropriately cross-referenced in the body of your report.
    - [ ] All figures should have alt text set.
    - [ ] There should be narrative text helping readers to better understand what each visualization helps them to learn about the data and context.

## Data Requirements

Your team may work with any data collection you wish, provided you satisfy certain conditions. These conditions include:

1) The data may not any of the sets/collections we've used in the class including any examples, homework, activities, quizzes, or other assignments.
2) The data should be real, not fake or synthetic. You may not use genAI tools to create or find data sets. If you are unsure, talk to your instructor. 
3) Your data sets/collections should be rich for exploration. That is, there should be multiple attributes (more than 3) for you to explore in your team. We __strongly encourage__ your team to look for multiple data sets/collections that you can link together so that the sets complement/supplement each other.
4) You must be able to explain the data provenance as fully as possible for each data set/collection you use. This includes the who, what, when, where, why, and how the data were originally collected.
5) You must be able to explain how your data satisfy (or not) both the FAIR and CARE principles.
6) Your data __may not__ come from or be found on Kaggle. It is your team's responsibility to complete this check. Projects using data from Kaggle will be treated as non-submissions.
7) Your data may not come from another project you are doing or have done for a grade in any other course without prior permission. This also includes any Honors thesis or projects.
8) You may only use data that you have a legal right to be using.

The key factor in determining whether a certain data set/collection is allowed is the analysis. We want your project to reflect __*your*__ thinking and skill sets from this course, not someone else's (including genAI). To this end, you cannot submit data analysis work that you've done on a particular data set for another course as this is a violation of Academic Integrity. Thus, if you want to use a data set/collection you've used in another course, you are going to have to provide clear documentation of what you've done for that other course and ensure that you (or any member of your team) do not duplicate that work for this project. 

We do not allow Kaggle data sets/collections to be used for this project for three reasons. First, the data that is shared on Kaggle is not necessarily real data. Second, the data (real or fake) may have been posted without permission or acknowledgement of the original data stewards. Finally, Kaggle data sets/collections often have data analysis reports of them posted. This then raises questions about whether we are looking at your work or you copying someone else.

If there are data sets you are interested in using found in R packages, talk to your instructor before using them. If you or a team member works in a research lab on campus and/or are doing research on campus, you may use that data provided you've been given written permission to use that data from the lab's Principle Investigator (typically, a faculty member in charge).

# Work-in-Progress Presentations

In the last week of classes (Dec. 8th--Dec. 12th, 2025), each group will give a __short/brief__ presentation to the class (<mark>approximately 5 minutes</mark>). In the presentation, each team will share

1) what they are exploring,
2) __one (1)__ insight they have had so far,and 
3) __one (1)__ challenge they have encountered as they work (if any). 

Each member of the team must take part in the presentation and speak. As the name suggests, these presentations are not meant for teams to present polished/completed reports. Rather, the idea is to convey what you're currently working on.

## Peer Feedback

While each team is giving their presentation, all other students in the class will be filling out a simple peer feedback form. Students who do not pay attention to their peers and provide meaningful feedback will receive a lower grade.

# Additional Guidance and Hints

There are a couple of pieces of advice that we want to give your team at this time for your project.

1) Planning will help your team get and stay organized.
2) Communicate! The success of your team will hinge upon how well you communicate with each other.
3) Draw upon each other's strengths and have everyone take a look at each other's work.
4) Proofread your report before you submit.
5) When you're unsure of something or running into a problem the team can't figure out, use your network of peers and your instructor.

## Data and Topics

Is your team stuck trying to figure out where to look for data or a topic to explore? Check out these resources.

- https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday

You can also check with your instructor to see if they might have some data files you might be able to use.

Keep in mind that if any team submits a project that looks too similar to work done by someone else it would be an academic integrity violation. 

### Topic Ideas

- How have popular songs changed over the last 5-6 decades? For instance, beats per minute, genres, number of unique words, etc.
- How have food prices changed in the past two decades? For instance, the average cost of vegetables, fruit, and meat, and the year-to-year inflation rates.
- How have the key economic factors changed over the last 5-6 decades? For instance, the unemployment rate, S&P 500 index, CPI, median salary, and Housing price index. 
- How has the eSports industry changed over the last decades? For instance, the number of tournaments, the number of people viewing the game, the total prize money, and the total estimated economic income (direct and indirect).

As a team you can discuss prompts such as the following to help you come up with ideas:

- What shared interests does your team have?
- Do you all like a particular sport? 
- Do you like a particular type of music? 
- Do you like to play video games?

If your team is completely struck, come talk to your instructor.

## What to Include in Your Exploratory Data Analysis

Channel the beliefs and dispositions of EDA in your work here. That is,

1) We construct our understandings of the data by investigating broad questions of "What is going on here?" and "What do we have?"
2) Data visualizations (tables, plots, graphs) play a central and vital role in making sense of data and the surrounding context.
3) Model building/hypothesis generation is an iterative process.
4) Use methods that are robust, resistant, smooth, and have breadth.
5) Maintain dispositions of skepticism, flexibility, and statistical ecumenism for methods used.

The EDA portion of work is what many people mess up: either because they skip it, don't do a good job, or don't spend the time on it that they should. However, this portion of data analysis is vital for you to truly be able to communicate later types of analysis in coherent and valid ways.

For this project, we recommend that you really focus on exploring the data and propose hypotheses/models for future analysis work.

### Moving Beyond EDA

A common way that Stat 184 students introduce unnecessary problems into their course project is attempting to move beyond EDA and use tools/methods from beyond the course. For example, using different forms of regression, ANOVA, machine learning algorithms (supervised and unsupervised), etc. We __do not__ recommend that you attempt to use these...even if you have seen them in another course. It has been our collective experience over multiple years that students who attempt to incorporate these techniques into this project 1) never do so correctly/coherently, and 2) end up focusing on those method instead of of the EDA. 

Teams will not receive any points/benefit for using methods from beyond Stat 184--however--teams can lose points if such methods are used incorrectly, poorly, and/or are explained in less than ideal ways.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

- __I want to work alone. Can I do this project by myself?__
  + No. Statistics and Data Science are deeply collaborative fields and you need to learn how to work effectively in a team setting. As such this project was designed with collaboration and team work as a core component.
  
- __Can we use a past project from another course for this project?__
  + No. Submitted work that you already received a grade in another course is a violation of the University's Academic Integrity policy.
  
- __Can we use a project from another (current) course for this project?__
  + No. There is not enough time for the faculty to meet and negotiate how one project will fully satisfy the requirements for the separate courses.
  
- __One of the team members works in a research lab. Can we use data from that lab for our project?__
  + YES! Provided you have permission from the lab's Principle Investigator (PI).
  
- __Can we use the data from another course's project?__
  + Tentatively, yes. Your team will need to disclose this as part of your data provenance and check with your instructor early on in the process. While you may use the data, you __*may not*__ use the same analysis as what was used in the other course's project. Be prepared to show the other course's project upon instructor request. 
  
- __Can I use Python (or another language)?__
  - STAT 184 is an R programming course, and the project is intended to evaluate learning objectives of this course so you should mostly be using R and your entire analysis must be self-contained in a single QMD. However, if you want to do something in the project that we have not learned about in class (using R) and prefer to use Python or some other language for that purpose it's fine to include some Python chunks in your QMD file.
