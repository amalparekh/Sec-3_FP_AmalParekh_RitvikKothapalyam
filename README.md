# Project Title

Pennsylvania PSSA Science Assessment Analysis. A data analysis project examining trends in Pennsylvania student science proficiency levels from 2008 to 2024 using Pennsylvania State System of Assessment (PSSA) data.

## Overview

This project examines over 15 years of PSSA science test score data to better understand how Pennsylvania students' science proficiency has changed over time. I analyzed how students are distributed across the four proficiency levels Advanced, Proficient, Basic, and Below Basic to identify meaningful trends in their performance. The goal was to determine whether Pennsylvania students are improving in science, facing new challenges, or maintaining consistent performance levels. These findings can help inform educational policy decisions and highlight specific areas where students may need additional support to succeed.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

- Data Source: Pennsylvania State System of Assessment (PSSA) - Overall science test scores by proficiency level
- The dataset includes statewide science assessment results from the 2008-09 school year through the 2023-24 school year
- Data provided as percentage distributions across four proficiency categories: Advanced, Proficient, Basic, and Below Basic

## Current Plan

- Clean and structure the PSSA data for analysis
- Visualize trends in student proficiency levels over the 15-year period
- Identify significant changes or patterns, particularly around the 2012-13 assessment changes and the COVID-19 pandemic period
- Calculate and compare the combined proficiency rates (Advanced + Proficient) across years
- Examine whether achievement gaps are widening or narrowing over time
- Provide interpretations and potential explanations for observed trends
